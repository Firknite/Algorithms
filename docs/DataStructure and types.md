# DataStructure and Types

## _What is data Structure and types?_

Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

_Note: Data structure and data types are slightly different. Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order._

## Types of Data Structure

## Linear
 - Array Data Structure
 - Stack Data Structure
 - Queue Data Structure
 - Linked List Data Structure

## Non-linear
 - Graph Data Structure
 - Trees Data Structure


## Linear VS Non-linear Data Structures

| Linear Data Structures | Non-Linear Data Structures |
| -- | -- |
| The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other. | The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner). |
| All the items are present on the single layer. | The data items are present at different layers. |
| It can be traversed on a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all the elements sequentially in a single pass. | It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass. |
| The memory utilization is not efficient. | Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need. |
| The time complexity increase with the data size. | Time complexity remains the same. |
| Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue | Example: Tree, Graph, Map |
